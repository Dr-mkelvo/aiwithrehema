# aiwithrehema

## this is the Repository for the Mozilla hackathon project for Ai.
 the purpose of the project is showcase usage of Ai in the medical industry to save on time that a patient waits before seing the doctor! this will help save lives and discomfort from long wait hours! 

#How it works.

 The program works by allowing one to send an audio to the doctor in swahili and the mozilla does a live translation to English ensuring the doctor can easily understand them. this is done prior to the patient visiting the hospital or doctor. Upon sending an appointment is booked and one can walk in and in a few minutes see the doctor for further consulatation.
